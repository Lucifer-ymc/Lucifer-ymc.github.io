Hello, everyone.



This is CSDo, a new hand in the vast computer world.
Currently I'm be as a CS junior student in China ZJU college, being abused by various projects every day.  

Up till now, I've learned C, C++, Java and a little python. Though still not proficient enough, those everyday projects are forging me to be stronger day by day.

This term I'm going to learn about OS, CA and CN. Hoping to have a more comprehensive understanding after this.
